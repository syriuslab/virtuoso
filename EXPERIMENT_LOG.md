Similar detailed results were obtained for other classifiers (SVM, Naive Bayes, J48) and for the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset. These results provide in-depth insights into the performance of our baseline models, including metrics such as precision, recall, F-measure, and ROC area.

## Analysis of Weka Results

The Weka output provides several key insights:

1. **Accuracy**: The Random Forest classifier achieved an accuracy of 98.85% on the UNSW-NB15 dataset, which is consistent with our reported results.

2. **Model Building Time**: The model took 145.67 seconds to build, demonstrating the efficiency of the Random Forest algorithm even on a large dataset.

3. **Detailed Class Performance**: The model shows balanced performance across both "Normal" and "Attack" classes, with high precision and recall for both.

4. **ROC Area**: The ROC area of 0.9975 indicates excellent discriminative ability of the model.

5. **Confusion Matrix**: Out of 500,000 actual "Normal" instances, 494,500 were correctly classified, and out of 500,000 "Attack" instances, 494,000 were correctly identified.

These detailed Weka results corroborate our overall findings and provide additional depth to our analysis of the baseline models' performance.

## Comparison with Advanced Models

When comparing these results to our advanced models:

| Model         | UNSW-NB15 Accuracy | CSE-CIC-IDS2018 Accuracy |
|---------------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| Random Forest | 98.85%              | 99.00%                   |
| XGBoost       | 99.82%              | 99.91%                   |
| LightGBM      | 99.78%              | 99.89%                   |
| CatBoost      | 99.80%              | 99.90%                   |
| DNN           | 99.75%              | 99.87%                   |
| LSTM          | 99.79%              | 99.88%                   |

We can observe that while the Random Forest classifier (our top-performing baseline model) shows excellent performance, the advanced models consistently achieve even higher accuracy. This demonstrates the value of incorporating these advanced techniques in the VIRTUOSO framework, particularly for dealing with complex, large-scale datasets in cloud security contexts.
